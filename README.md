## Project Description

This project is related to my master's thesis: understanding the
fundamental building blocks of a front-end and how it can be designed
to maintain engagement from a user visiting a text-heavy website.

The project was developed over 2 months, with the actual development of the
application—including Database setup, Front-end design, and Deployment—taking
6 weeks of concurrent development work while performing academic research.
